# Tracta

Tracta is an old app I created when sharpening my frontend tools.
It makes use of a webflow like editor and makes use of React to create a smooth.

This project is far from complete and ultimately I have moved on to other priorities.
However being able to dyanmically create styles based on user input and craft documents like this really increased my frontend knowledge.

Due to the frontend focus, Tracta uses supabase for storing data, at the moment it is not currently deployed :(
